Loopy, formerly known as LoopyEx, is an AirBNB clone project conceived during Le Wagon's Batch #986 Fullstack Web Development bootcamp. Our marketplace is geared toward fibre enthusiasts who want to sell the yarn in their stash, or buy yarn from others. Our app setup also allows for the selling of other objects outside of yarn.
